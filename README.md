# Game
A-Level course practice 4

In teams create a mini game. The idea of the game is: we have some characters, some enemies and some equipment. As well as some text-based interface.
Discuss among the team, common interfaces for actions. Characters and enemies should have some common actions as ‘Attack’, ‘Block’, etc.
Create common repository for people in the group. Create a project and a main branch.
One persone codes common interfaces and once done others pull this repo to local and implement each its own area:
Characters (Wizzard, Warrior etc)
Enemies (Goblin, Trol, etc)
Equipment (Sword, Wand etc)
Common text interface 
User can create character, give them some starter equipment, and be thrown into the battle with the randomly (or in any other way) generated enemy. Battle is simple attack or block.
If have time, can complicate it a bit and be able to equip defeeted enemy equipment, but only one at a time.
All the code should be done in separate branches created from the initial into ‘DEVELOPMENT’ branch created from the master.
Once done merge all code, and review and approve each others PR(s) into ‘DELOPMENT’ barcnch.
Once done, check you code compiles, builds and runs on smbs machine.
Create a PR from ‘DEVELOPMENT’ into main, for me to review.

Think about inheritance, polymorphism. Everything should be named properly. Figure out appropriate classes, methods.
